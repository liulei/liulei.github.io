I am a senior engineer at department of radio science and technology, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, CAS. My main research interests are:

- VLBI technique:
    - Software correlator.
    - Fringe search method and program for satellite signal in deep space exploration.
    - Geodetic VLBI fringe fitting.

- Space VLBI:
    - Simulation toolkit for trajectory and uv calculation, visibility simulation and beam/image reconstruction of space antennas.
    - Observation quality evaluation and scheduling.
    - Orbit design and optimization.
    - The Space Low Frequency Radio Observatory project.

- Pulsars and transients
    - VLBI pulsar data processing: correlation with pulsar gate and dedispersion, fringe fitting. 
    - Single pulse search pipeline. 
    - Pulsar signal synthesis

- SKA
    - Neutral hydrogen signal simulation.
    - Widefield imaging.

- High performance computing
    - Parallel architecture.
    - GPU acceleration.

- Cosmology, galaxy and cluster

- Data visualization
    - matplotlib
    - CesiumJS
    - Qt
