## Omni*UV*
Omni*UV* is a multi-purpose VLBI Simulation Toolkit. The main functionalities are: 
- Station trojectory calculation.
- *uv* calculation.
- Visibility simulation
- Image reconstruction.
  
At present Omni*UV* supports the following types of space and ground based stations:
- Earth fixed (ground)
- Earth orbit
- Moon fixed
- Moon orbit
- Earth-Sun Lagrange points
- Moon-Earth Lagrange points

Please refer to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/liulei/omniuv) for more details.

## VOLKS2
"VOLKS" is the acronym of "VLBI Observation for frb Localization Keen Searcher". As suggested by its name, VOLKS2 is a pipeline for the search and localization of radio transients. Since most of transients are of short duration, the searching process is extremely time consuming. Therefore, the idea of VOLKS2 pipeline is to perform transient search as commensal task in regular VLBI observations. Actually this is the meaning of its name: to mobilize the volks (发动群众).  Moreover, the pipeline can be used for transient data analysis in dedicated observations.
